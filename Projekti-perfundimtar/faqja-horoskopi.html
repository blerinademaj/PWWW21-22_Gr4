  <p><b>JAN 05, 2022:</b> Be careful not to react too soon to someone's urgent cries for help today.
                            Chances are, this is a textbook case of crying wolf—or this person may have a very distorted sense
                            of what 'urgent' really means. Either way, he or she wants attention but doesn't really need help,
                            and you don't have time to deal with this sort of immaturity right now. Let the drama distract someone else.
                            You have real obligations and responsibilities to take care of.

  <p><b>JAN 05, 2022:</b>  An innocent comment that someone makes may irk you—but keep
                            in mind that this person is just trying to help. Of course, this kind of help is the last thing you need!
                            If you aren't ready to hear other people's versions of the truth, let them know (in no uncertain terms).
                            Your ego is exceptionally sensitive lately, partially due to a power struggle that you lost.
                            If you take some time to lick your wounds, you will be back on track and feeling confident soon.

                            titillating conversation. You should definitely not go around looking for a fight, but it wouldn't be a bad
                            idea to step out of your comfort zone and experience a little bit of conflict right now.
                            It will strengthen some of your beliefs, challenge other beliefs, and give you some new ideas.
                            You can handle a lot of different opinions right now, and you will enjoy hearing what other people say.

                            You will have no trouble achieving what you set out to do right now, so don't be too conservative in your goals.
                            Aim high and really challenge yourself—the stars are encouraging you to put it all on the line and give yourself a task
                            that's way outside your comfort zone. A little bit of fear is even a good thing—it'll help motivate you.

                            But you also have to know when to stand your ground and not give in—not even an inch. Today, speak up if you just can't
                            go along with what everyone else is saying or doing. Sometimes the only way to get people to listen to you and respect
                            what you say is to force them to. A quiet word to the right person will get you all the satisfaction you need.

                            if you are in a group situation. It's time for you to take a bigger leadership role with your people,
                            and your attitude will be the perfect thing to motivate people who aren't usually 'team players' or cheerful participants.

<div class = "paragrafi">

<p>
Chinese astrology is based on the traditional astronomy. The development of Chinese astrology is tied to that of astronomy which came to flourish during the Han Dynasty. The Chinese Zodiac is one of the oldest known horoscope system in the world and consists of twelve animals that represent a certain year. According to Chinese astrology, the year of a person's birth is represented by one of these animals. The twelve animal signs or zodiac symbols are Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. Chinese astrology also has five elements of nature namely: water, wood, fire, earth and metal. According to Chinese astrology, a person's destiny can be determined by the position of the planets and the positions of the Sun and Moon at the person's time of birth. Chinese believe that our birth year can determine our attitude and potential and that animal birth signs have symbolism and represent a specific behavior.

<h2>
SOME TRUE FACTS ABOUT ASTROLOGY
</h2>
</div>
<div class = "paragrafi">

<p>
According to a 1999 study, the word horoscope and astrology are the two most searched topics on the Internet. Astrology is considered to be both an art and a science. Astrology is art because interpretation is needed to bring the different aspects together and formulate an idea of the individual's character traits. However, the mathematical part of astrology is also considered to be a science because it requires an understanding of astronomy and mathematics. Sixtus IV was the first Catholic pope to draw and interpret a horoscope, Leo X and Paul III always relied on astrologers for advice while Julius II has chosen his coronation date astrologically. Astrology was very important to Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Nazi Germany. It is thought that the German leader consulted astrologers throughout the Second World War.>
